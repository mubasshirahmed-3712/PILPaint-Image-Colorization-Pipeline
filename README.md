## 📌 Project Overview

**PILPaint** is a complete hands-on project that demonstrates both basic and advanced image processing techniques using the **Pillow (PIL)** library in Python.

The project is divided into two parts:

- 🧱 **Basic Transformations** – RGB channel analysis, rotation, flipping, and artistic filters
- 🎨 **Colorization Pipeline** – Grayscale to RGB reconstruction, tinting, blending, and output comparison

This project is ideal for anyone learning:

- Machine Learning / Computer Vision preprocessing
- Image manipulation fundamentals
- Artistic image enhancements
